// Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).
// Series:1+14+17+110+113+116+…\mathrm{Series:}\quad 1 + \frac14 + \frac17 + \frac1{10} + \frac1{13} + \frac1{16} + \dotsSeries:1+41​+71​+101​+131​+161​+…
// You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.


function SeriesSum(n) {
    for (var s = 0, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      s += 1 / (1 + i * 3)
