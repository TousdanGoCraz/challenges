//Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.
//Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.
//To convert fahrenheit to celsius:
//celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)


function weatherInfo (temperature) {
  var c = (temperature - 32) * (5/9)
  if (c < 0){
    return (c + " is freezing temperature")
  }else
    return (c + " is above freezing temperature")
}
