// Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

// The binary number returned should be a string.

    //P numbers, +, - , no floats, only numbers
    //R sum of numbers, in binary
    //p sum the numbers, parse as binary
